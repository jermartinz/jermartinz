# 👋 Hello, I'm Jeremy

I'm currently studying programming at university, with the goal of becoming a professional in the software development field. I enjoy combining formal education with self-learning to expand my skills and explore new technologies.

## 🧠 Interests

- 💻 **Web Development** — I have experience with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and some **Python** for scripting and backend basics.
- 🐧 **Linux & Dev Environments** — I use **Arch Linux** as my daily driver, and enjoy customizing my workflow.
- ⚙️ **Development Tools** — Comfortable using **Git**, **GitHub**, and terminal-based tools to improve efficiency and manage my projects.
- 📚 Currently learning **C++** and deepening my understanding of **data structures and algorithms**.

## 🚀 Learning Philosophy

I'm always looking to improve by learning something new — whether through university projects, online resources, or personal experimentation. My focus is on becoming a well-rounded developer capable of building practical and maintainable software.
