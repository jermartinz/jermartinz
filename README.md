# 👋 Hello, I'm Jeremy

I'm currently studying programming at university, aiming to become a professional software developer. I enjoy combining formal education with self-learning to grow my skills and explore new technologies.

## 🧠 Interests

- 💻 **Backend Development** — I’m learning and experimenting with **Python** for server-side programming, building scripts, and understanding APIs.  
- 🐧 **Linux & Dev Environments** — I use **Arch Linux** as my daily driver and enjoy customizing my workflow for efficiency.  
- ⚙️ **Development Tools** — Comfortable using **Git** and terminal-based tools to manage projects and improve productivity.

## 🚀 Learning Philosophy

I’m always looking to improve by learning something new — through university projects, online resources, or personal experimentation. My goal is to become a well-rounded developer capable of building practical, maintainable software.
